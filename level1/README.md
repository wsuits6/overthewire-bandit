-------------------------------
THe password for the the next level which is level 2.
is storred nthe home directory of level 1


plan 
----
 
All we have to do is log in and fid the file maybe it will be a hidden file or somehting

------------

since i finshed thelvel 0 the flag found in level zero is the password to level 1

Now I will chekc for possible file sand folders 
suingthe normal ls coomand all i can see is a "  - "

I use the ls -la command to be sure htat the dash is actaully a file and not soem terminal junk well ist a file 

since the dashb -is a file we catn read it usnghte ormal conventional cat method we have to specify its location as
./- 


inth efile I found the flag : 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
