# OverTheWire – Bandit Hacking

**Author:** Wsuits6
**Project:** Bandit Wargame Walkthrough

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire Bandit** wargame. It focuses on understanding Linux fundamentals, file systems, permissions, and basic security concepts through hands-on practice.

Each level contains:

* A clear explanation of what was done
* Commands used
* Screenshots where helpful

This is part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

## 📸 Image Usage

Each level contains an `images/` directory used to visually document progress.

Images are referenced directly inside each level’s `README.md` using relative paths, for example:

```md
![Login Screen](./images/login.png)
```

This keeps the documentation clean and portable.
